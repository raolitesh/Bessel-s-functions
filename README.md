# Bessel's functions of first and second kinds
# In this project, I derived, from basics, one of the important functions in differential equations, i.e., Bessel's functions of first and second kinds.
- These functions are solutions to the following Bessel's differential equation:
  $$x^2 \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + x \frac{dy}{dx} + (x^2 - p^2)y = 0, \text{  where  } p \geq 0$$
**It covers all cases for different values of $p$**
- It also includes an example when $p =1$.
